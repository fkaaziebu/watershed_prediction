# Load model issue

An error occurs when the source_sink_analysis.py file running the model on line 37

Here is the error message:
```
Error in Analyze Source-Sink Dynamics: Could not deserialize 'keras.metrics.mse' because it is not a KerasSaveable subclass
  Please check the error message above and try again.
```

I am not sure what the issue is, add a doc on it about how to fix it and also fix the issue.
